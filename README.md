# Deep Episodic Memory
Learning new skills from sensorimotor experi- ences in varying contexts and transferring knowledge to new domains is still a challenge in robotics. We analyze recent contributions in robotics towards modelling action sequences and learning from demonstrations. Discussing limitations, we argue that symbolic representations limit existing approaches in their modelling power and restrict the capabilities for gen- eralization and knowledge transfer. Encouraged by the recent advances in deep learning, we analyse the suitability of deep neural networks for learning representations of sensorimotor experiences. In this regard, unsupervised learning approaches for video frame prediction show potential for generating meaningful subsymbolic representations as well as matching and reconstructing visual experiences.
